When importing a resource (an image in this case) you have the option of importing a local resource or a project resource. What is the difference?

Resource context
Visual Studio supports two resource scopes: local and project. Select the context for your resources by clicking the appropriate radio button.

Local Resources are seen by only the form (or control) in question. They are imported to the form's corresponding .resx file and can generally only be used on that form.

Project Resources are imported to your main project's resource file Resources.resx They can be used anywhere in your project.
